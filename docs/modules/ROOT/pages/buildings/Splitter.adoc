The splitter allows you to control the flow of items.

It has one conveyor input and three outputs.

It has an inventory. When the inventory is empty, it will automatically transfer one item from the input to the inventory..

Each output also has its own output inventory, where the code can move items from the input inventory into it.
If the inventory is full, the code cannot move any item into the output inventory.
As long as the output inventory contains a item the corresponding conveyor output can grab these items.
